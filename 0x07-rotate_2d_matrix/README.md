## Introduction:
he task is to modify the matrix in place, meaning you cannot use any extra space for another matrix, and you have to perform the rotation using the given matrix structure.

The challenge requires an understanding of how to manipulate rows and columns in a matrix to achieve the desired rotation efficiently. This is a common problem in algorithmic interviews and has various applications in image processing and computer graphics.

### 
For the “0. Rotate 2D Matrix” project, you are tasked with implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. This challenge requires a good understanding of matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python. Below are the key concepts and resources that you need to grasp in order to successfully complete this project.

### Concepts Needed:
1. **Matrix Representation in Python:

* Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python.
* Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D matrix.

2. In-place Operations:

* Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure.
* The importance of minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.

3. Matrix Transposition:

* Understanding the concept of transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns).
* Implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.

4. Reversing Rows in a Matrix:

* Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.

5. Nested Loops:

* Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices.
* Modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.
