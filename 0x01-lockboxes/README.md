## Introduction:
This project focuses on solving a classic problem where you are given a series of boxes, each potentially containing keys to other boxes. The challenge is to determine whether you can unlock all the boxes starting from the first one.

## Must Know
For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. Hereâ€™s a list of concepts and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this project:

### Concepts Needed:
